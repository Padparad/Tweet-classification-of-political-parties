# Tweet-classification-of-political-parties

This study delves into Twitter data from Northern European politicians, exploring hashtags, political views, and gender features. While unveiling diverse hashtag patterns, distinct political landscapes, and varied gender distributions, our analysis extends beyond description to include a prediction model. Rigorously testing various classification algorithms, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), we implemented a RandomForest Classifier, achieving an accuracy of approximately 74%. However, the exploration of alternative models reveals the complexities in predicting political inclinations from social media content. This dual approach not only provides valuable insights into the digital discourse and political dynamics of Northern European politicians on Twitter but also sheds light on both successful outcomes and challenges in classifying political views.
